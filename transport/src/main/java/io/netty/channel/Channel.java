/**
 *
 * Channel 是netty中提供的对网络操作的抽象类,类似于NIO中的Channel (java.nio.SocketChannel/java.nio.ServerSocketChannel)
 *
 * 对网络套接字或者有I/O操作能力(例如读,写,连接和绑定)的模块的关联(抽象?)
 *
 *
 *
 * channel为使用者提供的功能:
 * 1、channel当前的状态(例如是不是打开? 是不是连接上了?)
 * 2、channel的配置参数(例如接收缓冲区大小)
 * 3、提供I/O操作(例如读,写,连接和绑定)
 * 4、提供ChannelPipeline,用于处理所有的I/O事件和关联到channel的请求
 *
 *
 *
 * channel的一些注意事项：
 * 1、所有的I/O操作都是异步的
 *      netty中所有的I/O操作都是异步的. 这意味着任何I/O调用都将立即返回而不保证请求的I/O操作在调用结束时已经完成. 替代的是,你将得到一个返回的 ChannelFuture 实例, 当请求的I/O操作成功,失败或者取消时将通知你.
 * 2、channel是有等级的(hierarchical)
 *      2-1、channel可以有一个parent, 取决于它是如何创建的. 例如, SocketChannel 是 ServerSocketChannel 在接受连接时创建的. SocketChannel 的parent()方法就会返回这个ServerSocketChannel.
 *      2-2、等级结构的语义取决于channel所属的 transport 的实现. 例如, 可以写一个新的Channel实现, 创建子channel用于分享一个socket连接, 像BEEP 和 SSH 那样.
 * 3、向下溯型来访问传输特有(transport-specific)操作
 *      某些transport 暴露transport特有的一些额外的操作. 将Channel向下溯型为子类型来调用这些操作. 例如, 对于老的I/O datagram transport, DatagramChannel 提供了 multicast join / leave 操作.
 * 4、释放资源
 *      有一个非常重要的事情, 当你完成channel的处理之后, 需要调用close() 或 close(ChannelPromise) 方法来释放所有的资源. 这样可以确保所有的资源以正确的方式被释放, 例如文件操作等.
 *
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *
 * <h3>Release resources</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is important to call {@link #close()} or {@link #close(ChannelPromise)} to release all
 * resources once you are done with the {@link Channel}. This ensures all resources are
 * released in a proper way, i.e. filehandles.
